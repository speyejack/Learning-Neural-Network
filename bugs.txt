BUG:
-If you set a training batch size = 10000, it will get a seg fault.

- Currently after running network it converges to answers being NAN or weights quickly increase in size.
can be reproduced w/
gate = ||
seed = 1486755178
batch size = 1000
step size = 0.1
for = 1000 times
happens around 570

or...

gate = ||
seed = 1486755178
batch size = 10
step size = 0.1
for = 100,000 times
happens in 2000 range
